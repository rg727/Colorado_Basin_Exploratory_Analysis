# UCRB_Exploratory_Analysis

This repositotory contains the code to generalize the StateMod exploratory analysis for any of the seven subbasins of the Colorado River Basin. 

Flows at the last USGS gage in each basin are compiled for the Colorado, Gunnison, San Juan/Dolores, Yampa/White, and Platte basins.

Colorado Exploratory Analysis Workflow Jupyter notebook completes all steps aside from the parallel generation of flows, which is found in this repository. 

Move all create files from the Jupyter notebook into the QGEN folder and execute "sbatch generate_flows.sh"
